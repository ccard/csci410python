Instructions on how to run:
-The entire program is run from JackCompiler.py
-The program saves the output files to the same directory as the input files but
appends a 2 on to the end so the files look like '*2.xml'
-The program is run by calling <your python run comand here> JackCompiler.py <option (-t for the tokenized output)
or omit it if you want to run the full program> <path to desired directory or path to desired file>
